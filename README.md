# Leaf-counting-dataset-Classification-



In this Project, By using the Keras implementation of VGG-16 as a starting point.

- Using the first 2 blocks of VGG-16 add extra Keras layers to create version a CNN network for the classification of the images according to the number of leaves in the plant images. We have  5 classes. The last layer from VGG-16 will be block2 pool and available to add no more than five fully connected or convolutional layers to the network including the final output layer.


- Train this simple network on the training set while monitoring convergence on the validation set.
As input to the model use images of size no larger than 128Ã—128.

The NootBook contains:
1.  Plot of loss curve for training and validation data
2.  Plot an accuracy curve for training and validation data
3.  Plot of a confusion matrix of the network on the training including validation and testing data sets.


### Part 1 Transfer Learning - Classification
### Part 2 Transfer Learning - Regression 
### Part 3 Improve The  Model (Regularization and data augmentation are common strategies to deal with small datasets)
